Investec Bank coding assignments in Go

These assignments are required by Investec to be done in Java, but I decided to do them in Go as well. 

### Assignment Questions

1. Find the highest common factor for a given array of integers.


2. Given the attached addresses.json file which contains an array of addresses, do the following:

    a. Write a function to return a pretty print version of an address in the format: Type: Line details - city - province/state - postal code – country.

    b. Write a function to pretty print all the addresses in the attached file.

    c. NA
